This directory contains some helper scripts.

build-grub-signed
*****************

This script "builds" a signed GRUB for use with UEFI SecureBoot. 
It needs to be run for every new version of GRUB that should be 
used with UEFI boot on 64bit UEFI systems.

The scripts creates a signed version of GRUB in 
config/includes.binary/efi/boot/grubx64.efi. This file should then
be committed to the repository so that others can use it.

The script requires the sbsigntool package currently not (yet) available
in Debian. You can build it from https://github.com/imedias/sbsigntool.

Usage:
./build-grub-signed -k key -c cert -g grubpkg -e environments

 -k key             Path to private key file (PEM encoded) (required)
 -c cert            Path to certificate (PEM encoded) (required)
 -g grubpkg         Path to grub-efi-amd64-bin Debian package. This has to be downloaded 
                    or built separately and should match the architecture of the Debian 
                    Live system. (required)
 -e environments    Space separated list of environments where the signed binary should
                    be installed. Enclose in "" to avoid shell escaping.
                    (Defaults to "wheezy wheezy-pu")
