# Building the system with recommends enabled pulls in a lot of packages we
# don't want to have. Unfortunately, we have no blacklist while building the
# system so we have to remove them here right afer installing them...

# This is a special list for the "Lernstick mini" version:
# - cinnamon-desktop-environment recommends gimp

apt-get purge -y \
	gimp \
	gimp-data

# clean up
apt-get purge -y --auto-remove
